Singleplayer Quake Map for Game Design II

Description:

The idea was inspired by games like Resident Evil, House of Jumpscares, Clue, MyHouse.Wad, and Luigi's Mansion. I wanted to drop the player in the middle of spooky night, after they were chased into a 19th century victorian mansion by zombies. Being locked inside, the player is forced to explore the mansion. From killing enemies to fighting bosses, the player travels further down and starts over and over again at the beginning with small changes to the place. Eventually the mansion transforms into something else entirely. Your job is to escape, and find out the truth of this place.

Each room typically houses enemies, items, upgrades, weapons, traps, secret passageways, or even bosses. Though of course you don't know what is behind the door, that will be the fun of exploring. Of course in the short version, the player would just explore 1 cycle of the mansion, ending up jumping into a bottomless pit.
